output shape : (batch, steps, units)
input shape : (batch, steps, units)
(For having variable lengths in each batch, use input_shape=(None,features).

batch : Tank A ~ N
steps : 5 hours
input units : Temperature, Pressure
ouput unit : Results

In stateful=False, the second batch contains whole new sequences, independent from the first batch
In stateful=True, the second batch continues the first batch, extending the same sequences.
until you call model.reset_states()
we need shuffle=False <- batch? step? ¼ÅÇÃ
